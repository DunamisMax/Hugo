Welcome to the repository for [dunamismax.com](https://dunamismax.com/), a personal blog and learning platform built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [hugo-paper](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper) theme. Here, you’ll find posts about IT leadership, software engineering, Go (Golang), and personal growth as an IT Director transitioning into a software engineering role.

## Features

- **Static Site Generation with Hugo:**
  Hugo provides a fast and flexible framework for building static websites. It’s easy to manage content, generate pages, and customize layouts.

- **Custom Theme Integration:**
  Using the `hugo-paper` theme as a base, this site applies a custom avatar, unique color styles, and a tailored look that reflects my personal brand.

- **Local Font & Image Processing:**
  The site demonstrates Hugo Pipes capabilities to resize and process images (e.g., the user avatar) at build time, ensuring efficient load times and high-quality display.

- **Responsive Design & Dark Mode:**
  Tailwind CSS classes integrated into the `hugo-paper` theme ensure a responsive, mobile-friendly design. A built-in dark mode toggle offers readers a comfortable viewing experience in any environment.

- **Multimedia & Syntax Highlighting:**
  Supports KaTeX for math rendering and highlight.js for code snippets (optionally disabled), making it easy to share technical posts and tutorials.
