## being alone on New Years is dope actually

Spending New Year’s Eve alone can sound like a bummer in theory, but in practice, it can be downright glorious. Instead of fielding invites to noisy gatherings or pretending to enjoy stale party mixes, I decided to go deep into learning Rust and treat myself to a night of unhurried coding, crispy nuggets, and a classic sci-fi action flick.

### Diving into Rust on New Year’s Eve

As an IT Director by day, I often juggle a variety of systems and priorities, but at night I switch gears into Rust enthusiast mode. This year, I dedicated the countdown to learning more about async programming in Rust. The best thing? No interruptions. I had the freedom to explore new crates (like [Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio)), experiment with concurrency patterns, and get a few “aha!” moments all on my own schedule.

Here’s a small snippet I tinkered with just for fun, illustrating basic async behavior:

```rust
use tokio::time::{sleep, Duration};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    println!("Starting countdown...");
    for i in (1..=5).rev() {
        println!("{}...", i);
        sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)).await;
    }
    println!("Happy (Solo) New Year!");
}
```

This snippet provided a nice alternative to the usual social media countdown. It also let me experiment with Rust’s fearless concurrency while indulging in hot, crispy chicken nuggets—truly a multitasking marvel.

### Nuggets & Terminator Marathon

When I finally took a break from my Rust deep dive, I threw some chicken nuggets in the oven. Nuggets may not be the fanciest meal, but they pair surprisingly well with code commits and test runs. After fueling up, I kicked back to watch “Terminator.” There’s something about celebrating the arrival of a new year with an ‘80s sci-fi classic—especially when you’re developing in a futuristic programming language like Rust!

### Why Being Alone is Underrated

Between writing code and jumping into an unstoppable cyborg thriller, I realized how relaxing solitude can be. It gave me the mental space to learn at my own pace, experiment with code, and reflect on what I want to accomplish in the new year—both personally and in my ongoing Rust journey. Sometimes, “alone time” is the perfect environment for growth, creativity, and the occasional plate of midnight snacks.

### Final Thoughts

Whether you’re a fellow Rust learner, an open-source enthusiast, or simply an introvert at heart, don’t underestimate the power of welcoming the new year in your own company. You can tackle new personal projects, discover new open-source communities to contribute to, or simply tune into the things that excite you most—like hacking on Rust and savoring some (slightly overcooked) nuggets. Who said you needed a crowded party to have a great New Year’s?
